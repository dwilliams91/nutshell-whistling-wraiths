# Nutshell Overview:

Nutshell is a social media app developed as a group project for Nashville Software School. It involves features like:

1) having a friends lists
2) Public and Private messaging
3) Event planning
4) News Articles
5) To do lists

# How to Run Nutshell
After downloading, cd into the API directory in your terminal and type in "json-server -p 8088 -w db.json". This turns on the json server. Next, from the root directory, type in "serve" on your terminal to run the program. Create an account and login in. 

# My contributions
I specifically worked on the public and private message feature as well as the ability to edit an article.
